# GDQuest Product Packager

Product Packager is a tool to help creators package and publish their tutorial series, courses, tools, and other products to platforms like [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/), [Itch.io](https://itch.io/), or [Mavenseed](https://mavenseed.com/).

It is currently early in development and not suitable for production use.
