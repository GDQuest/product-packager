	<brief_description>
		Six square textures representing the faces of a cube. Commonly used as a skybox.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A cubemap is made of 6 textures organized in layers. They are typically used for faking reflections in 3D rendering (see [ReflectionProbe]). It can be used to make an object look as if it's reflecting its surroundings. This usually delivers much better performance than other reflection methods.
		This resource is typically used as a uniform in custom shaders. Few core Godot methods make use of [Cubemap] resources.
		To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the Godot Editor import presets.
		[b]Note:[/b] Godot doesn't support using cubemaps in a [PanoramaSkyMaterial]. You can use [url=https://danilw.github.io/GLSL-howto/cubemap_to_panorama_js/cubemap_to_panorama.html]this tool[/url] to convert a cubemap to an equirectangular sky map.
