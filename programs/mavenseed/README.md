# Mavenseed tools

Mavenseed is a website and course creation platform by the creators of the [Blender Market](https://mavenseed.com/).

We use it to publish and sell [our Godot courses](http://gdquest.mavenseed.com/courses).

This directory contains command-line tools to help save some time working with the platform.


Tools:

- `publish_lessons.py`: uploads lessons to a given Mavenseed course, creating chapters and new lessons as needed. Usage: run `python3 publish_lessons.py --help`
