	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A 3D heightmap shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a [CollisionShape3D]. This is useful for terrain, but it is limited as overhangs (such as caves) cannot be stored. Holes in a [HeightMapShape3D] are created by assigning very low values to points in the desired area.
		[b]Performance:[/b] [HeightMapShape3D] is faster to check collisions against than [ConcavePolygonShape3D], but it is significantly slower than primitive shapes like [BoxShape3D].
